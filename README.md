# Wine_Classification_and_Quality_Prediction_Major_Project
Several machine learning models, including RandomForestClassifier and RandomForestRegressor, were trained and evaluated for both classification and regression tasks, respectively. The performance of each model was assessed using a variety of metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error, RMSE, and R-squared.
